The Path To Enlightenment

You can run the tests through rake or by calling the file itself (rake is the recommended way to run them as we might build more functionality into this task).

*nix platforms, from the ruby_koans directory

[ruby_koans] $ rake                           # runs the default target :walk_the_path
[ruby_koans] $ ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb  # simply call the file directly

Windows is the same thing

c:\ruby_koans\rake                             # runs the default target :walk_the_path
c:\ruby_koans\ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb    # simply call the file directly
